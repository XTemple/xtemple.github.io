    <h1>Detention Stats</h1>

    <p>
      <strong>DetentionStats.com</strong> is an independent data visualization project that presents publicly available immigration detention data released by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The goal is to make this data more accessible, understandable, and transparent to the general public, policymakers, researchers, and journalists.
    </p>

    <p>
      The visualizations on this site are generated from ICE’s biweekly detention statistics, which are published without access restrictions on
      <a href="https://www.ice.gov/detain/detention-management" target="_blank">ice.gov</a>.
      This site does not alter the data beyond cleaning and organizing it for clarity and usability in public-facing dashboards.

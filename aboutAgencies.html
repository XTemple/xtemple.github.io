      <h2>Agencies Involved</h2>
      <p>
        This dashboard includes data from two federal agencies that carry out immigration enforcement operations under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS):
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>ICE = Immigration and Customs Enforcement</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Primary Role:</strong> Detains noncitizens already inside the United States, often after an immigration court hearing or local law enforcement referral.</li>
        <li><strong>Funding:</strong> ICE receives federal appropriations to operate detention facilities, contract with private operators, and fund removal operations.</li>
        <li><strong>Detention Data:</strong> The majority of detainees in ICE custody fall under ICE’s direct supervision. This includes facilities across the U.S. that are run by ICE or through agreements with state and local governments or private contractors.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>CBP = Customs and Border Protection</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Primary Role:</strong> Conducts immigration enforcement at ports of entry and along the border. Often detains individuals at or shortly after entry.</li>
        <li><strong>Funding:</strong> CBP is funded to operate short-term holding facilities and conduct border operations. Detainees may be temporarily held before being transferred to ICE custody.</li>
        <li><strong>Detention Data:</strong> This dashboard includes CBP detention counts for comparative purposes, but most long-term detentions are managed by ICE.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Funding Context</h2>
      <p>Both ICE and CBP operate on publicly appropriated tax dollars, with budgets authorized by Congress. In fiscal year 2024:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>ICE received ~$8 billion</strong>, with over $2.9 billion dedicated to custody operations.</li>
        <li><strong>CBP received ~$18 billion</strong>, most of which is allocated to border operations, staffing, and infrastructure—not long-term detention.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Understanding the differences in roles and spending between these agencies helps contextualize the statistics in this dashboard.</p>

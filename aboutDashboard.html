      <h2>About This Dashboard</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>DetentionStats.com</strong> is a public dashboard that visualizes data from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on individuals detained in the United States. The dashboard is updated <strong>biweekly</strong> and reflects data as published in ICE’s <em>Detention Management Statistics</em> spreadsheets. It aims to make government detention data more accessible, transparent, and digestible to the public, policymakers, journalists, and advocates.
